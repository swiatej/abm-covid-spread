# Agent-Based Model for COVID-19 spread in DCU Glasnevin campus

### _This project is a group assignment for the CA4024 "Building Complex Computational Models" module._
---

## Project Components and How to run model

The main python code is stored in the [**virus_spread.py**](virus_spread.py) file and the code for a 2D graphical display of the model's performance is presented in the [**pycxsimulator.py**](pycxsimulator.py) file. 
The [**dcu_map.png**](images/dcu_map.png) file is a visual representation of the Dublin City University Glasnevin campus map that we used for our experiments.

The user should be able to run the model by cloning this repository, and running "python virus_spread.py" in their terminal.

It is possible to change various parameters such as population size, movement speed, probability of contracting COVID, probability of wearing masks / vaccinations (or getting rid of them altogether).

The *virus_spread.py* script outputs two .csv files once it has finished running, and stores them in the same subdirectory:
* [**Infections_ID.csv**](Infections_ID.csv) - Dated counts of isolating people and people currently infected
* [**Isolation_And_Infection_Counts.csv**](Isolation_And_Infection_Counts.csv) - Time of new infection, along with student id and faculty name of COVID spreader, and student id and faculty name of newly infected

The script [**visualisation.py**](visualisation.py) takes in the Infections_ID and Isolation_And_Infection_Counts csv's and creates plots. These can be accessed in the [**graphs folder**](graphs).
The [**visualisation.py**](visualisation.py) script takes as user input the number of spreaders and outputs a community network graph of the top spreaders and the people they have infected (file is called [**community_network_graph.png**](graphs/community_network_graph.png)).
The second plot that is created is a visual representation of a COVID-19 Infections and Isolations, called [**COVID-19_infections_and_isolations_graph.png**](graphs/COVID-19_infections_and_isolations_graph.png).

## Model overview

Over the course of this assignment, an agent-based model for COVID-19 spread was developed.
We decided to base the model on Dublin City University's campus, with a couple buildings representing the different locations that COVID-19 can spread in. The buildings we chose are as follows: NuBar (DCU's student bar), Gym, Library, Business building, Science building, Computing building.

The model is based on the PYCX simulator, providing an easy visualisation of COVID hotspots and infections.
The model has an easy-to-use GUI: the user can change parameters such as probability of COVID, movement speed, as well as mask wearing and vaccination uptake.

The model is designed to be as accurate as possible:

* People are more prone to infections in areas such as the gym or the bar
* People are only infectious on days 6-13 of their sickness, and recover on day 14
* While sick, a portion of people chooses to self-isolate at home, thus not infecting anyone
* Masks and vaccinations lessen the chances of becoming infected
* People are not able to transmit COVID when they are at home
